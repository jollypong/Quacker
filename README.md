## Description

This is a back-end application for Quacker, a start-up backend project for Social Media Network. 

This application was made using JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node JS, Express.JS API and NPM Packages. 

This application is currently not deployed as it does not have a frontend developed. 

## Installation

  For Installation, you are required the following:
